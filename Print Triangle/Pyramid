Step-by-step Explanation:

n = 5: Sets the number of rows in the pyramid.

for i in range(1, n + 1): Loops from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

spaces = ' ' * (n - i): Calculates the number of spaces needed on each side to center the stars.

For row 1: 4 spaces
For row 2: 3 spaces
...
For row 5: 0 spaces

stars = '*' * (2 * i - 1): Calculates the number of stars for the current row.

For row 1: 1 star

For row 2: 3 stars

For row 3: 5 stars
...
For row 5: 9 stars

print(spaces + stars + spaces): Prints the spaces, then the stars, then spaces again to keep the pyramid centered.

this is code in python is here:-

n = 5  # Number of rows
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    spaces = ' ' * (n - i)
    stars = '*' * (2 * i - 1)
    print(spaces + stars + spaces)

My Output is here      //The Time Complexity is Big O(n2)
