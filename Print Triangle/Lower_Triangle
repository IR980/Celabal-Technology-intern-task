Step-by-step Explanation:

n = 5: Sets the number of rows to 5.

for i in range(1, n + 1):  Loops from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

print('*' * i): In each iteration, prints i asterisks (*).

1st row: 1 star

2nd row: 2 stars
...
5th row: 5 stars

this is my code is here

n = 5  # Number of rows
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('*' * i)

// The Time Complexity is Big O(n2)

The output is here :-
 * 
 *  *
 *  *  *
 *  *  *  *
 *  *  *  *  *
