Step-by-step Explanation:

n = 5: Sets the number of rows to 5.

for i in range(n, 0, -1): Loops from 5 down to 1 (inclusive), decreasing by 1 each time.

print('*' * i): In each iteration, prints i asterisks.

1st row: 5 stars

2nd row: 4 stars
...
5th row: 1 star


this is my code is here

n = 5  # Number of rows

for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('*' * i)

// The Teme Complexity is Big O(n2)

the output is:-
* * * * *
  * * * *
    * * *
      * *
        *
